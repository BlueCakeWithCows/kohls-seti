# Earth-Moon-Earth Doppler Factor Predictions
Mason Kohls, Berkeley SETI Research Center, Spring 2020

## Introduction
One method for determining Earth's technosignature is to examine the radio waves reflected by the moon back towards the Earth. Radio signals emitted from the Earth and reflected off the Moon are subject to two doppler shifts: when the Moon 'bounces' the signal and when it is recieved on Earth. In this project I generate predictions for the doppler factor for arbitrary emitter and reciever locations on Earth.
